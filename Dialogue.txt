To make dialogue for a song you'll have to make a file named: dialogue.txt
This will play when you start the song unless you have an intro cutscene in the storyboard.

If you have a storyboard, you will have to add these lines:

```
--SECTION-Intro--
0,Dialogue,"&dialogue.txt"
--END-SECTION--
```

If you want dialogue in the middle of a song you'll want to use storyboards.

Here is an example of a storyboard that will open a dialogue box after 5 seconds.

```
KMTStoryBoard v0.2

--SECTION-Gameplay--
5000,Dialogue,"&good_work.txt"
--END-SECTION--
```

---------

Syntax:

Dialogue syntax is `:character:text`

Command syntax is `>command<arguments`

Arguments are separated by a comma ,

Example:
```
>togglebgfade<
>toggletextfx<
>toggledroptext<
>fontcolor<0xFF000000,0xFFaabbcc

>flip<
:dad:You think you can defeat me?

>flip<
:bf:Beepboop

:gf:Good luck
```

Dialogue.

The format is almost the same as the original game, just that you can have any portrait as you want to.

Custom portraits should be put in the `images/dialogue/portraits` folder.
This should be done in the mod folder.

When the text `PORTRAIT_NAME` appears, you should replace it with a custom name.

Single image portraits and animated intro portraits are both options that you can use.

Single Image Portraits are defined by just having an image named `PORTRAIT_NAME.png`

Animated Intro Portraits are defined by having 2 files named `PORTRAIT_NAME.png` and `PORTRAIT_NAME.xml`

The XML file animation-name should be named `portrait enter`.

If you override an existing portrait that has an XML with a single image portrait, then you'll need to create a file named `PORTRAIT_NAME.noanim`

If the portrait is placed incorrectly, you can make a file named `PORTRAIT_NAME.offset`.
The file should contain 2 numbers separated by a comma.
Example:

```
-40,20
```

Offsets the portrait by -40 on the x-axis and 20 on the y-axis.
If you want to make the portrait in the center you just write "center" in the file

If you want to flip the portrait you can make a file named `PORTRAIT_NAME.flip`

The pre-existing portraits are:
bf
bfChristmas
bfPixel (animated)
dad
gf
mom
monster
monsterChristmas
none
parentsChristmas
pico
senpai (animated)
spooky
